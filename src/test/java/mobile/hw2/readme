1. Rewrite (complete) Driver using “singleton” pattern. Are there any advantages?
Done.
We can reach a driver instance from all tests. Also, we are able to control driver creation/modification.

2. Suggest improvements for .properties reading. What are the purposes?
I'd suggest to replace inheritance of TestProperties.class with Driver.class with delegation of TestProperties object
as declared field in Driver.class. This will prevent our Driver from having unnecessary methods and variables
from the parent class.

3. Add checks of other fields and their titles (Contact Name, Contact phone) in “native” test
Done.
1. Added checks for field’s titles.
2. Added check for screen title.
3. Added checks for fields are displayed.

4. Optional: Add keyboard presence check in “native” test.
Not done (since optional) due to lack of time.

5. Which checks would you place in the “web” test?
1. Check the header logo is displayed
2. Check the response coming from the target page
3. Check there are 3 sections in home-panels presented
