1. Add support of appPackage and appActivity parameters for Android devices (reading from a .properties file and then
setting in the DesiredCapabilities). Locally installed Appium DT has no need in these parameters, but for Appium server
of Minsk Mobile Farm it’s mandatory.
Done. Required fields and initialization for those are added to Driver.class.
Driver URL was pointed to the mobileFarm url with a personal token.

a.	Or try to use autoLaunch capability with app as before. Does this approach work?
I wasn't able to make it works. Every time I'm getting:
{
"status":13,
"value":{
      "message":"An unknown server-side error occurred while processing the command.
      Original error: The desired capabilities must  include either an app, appPackage or browserName"
   },
   "sessionId":null
}


2. Change settings to run web test on a certain iOS device on Mobile Test Farm. Run test with your changes. Did test pass?
Done. The test passed.
clean test -DsuiteXmlFile=mobile/ios_iphone5s_web.xml


3.Change settings to run native test on a certain/random Android device on Mobile Test Farm. Run test with your changes. Did test pass?
Done. Test passed.
clean test -DsuiteXmlFile=mobile/android_nexus5_native.xml


4.What’s wrong with our code? How to fix/improve it? Implement your suggestions.
a. It's not that easy to modify .properties every time we run test for various set of devices, so I've replaced them
with .json files that store set of capabilities specified for the particular device.

b. I've added .xml with configs (for both android and ios devices) to run tests using testNG functionality

c. It's a good practice to get rid of hardcoded (green) values in our code, so I've added couple enums that store
names of browsers, some constants, texts for errors
